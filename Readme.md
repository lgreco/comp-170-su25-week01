## Reading assignment

Reading assignment is based on the course's textbook; while I do not require the book, if you continue in the CS major other instructors will require it. The second column in the table below provides links to an online book, matching the textbook topics. The online book is available at no cost to you when you access O'Reilly Learning using your LUC email address.
