# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 00


[Class notes](https://lgreco.github.io/cdp/COMP170/weekly/week00.html) for first week. 

After reading these notes, please complete the [Lab 00](./lab-00.md) assignment. Some of the questions in the lab were not covered during our class discussion; they are covered in the class notes. Do your best -- it's ok if you don't get everything straight the first time. **In fact, it's more important** to note the lab questions that you find difficult and let me know about them -- this will allow us to take some time and review those topics.
