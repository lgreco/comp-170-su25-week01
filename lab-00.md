## Instructions

Complete the following assignments in the provided `main.py` file. For each problem, write your answers within the triple quotes ("""...""") provided under each problem's comment.
For full credit make sure to include the phrase you are examining in your solution.

## Problem 1: Variable Names

Evaluate the following variable names. For each, explain why it is valid or invalid as a Python variable name:

1. `first_name`
2. `2nd_name`
3. `age`
4. `total_amount`
5. `while`
6. `Student`
7. `my-variable`
8. `for`
9. `_temp`
10. `value#`

## Problem 2: Function Names

Evaluate the following function names. For each, explain why it is valid or invalid as a Python function name:

1. `calculate_total`
2. `3rd_function`
3. `print_values`
4. `find-item`
5. `def`
6. `updateProfile`
7. `my_function`
8. `try`
9. `init_data`
10. `value@function`

## Problem 3: Boolean Expressions

Evaluate the following boolean expressions. For each:
- If it's a valid expression, show what it evaluates to and explain why.
- If it's not valid, explain why it's not valid.

1. `True and False`
2. `5 > 3 or "apple" < "banana"`
3. `not 10 <= 20`
4. `True or 5 = 4`
5. `"apple" != "orange" and 5`
6. `3 < 5 not True`
7. `False == (3 > 4)`
8. `10 <= "10"`
9. `True or not False`
10. `5 and or 4`
